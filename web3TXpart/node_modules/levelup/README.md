Introduction
------------

**[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)** is a simple key/value data store built by Google, inspired by BigTable. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular *get*, *put* and *delete* operations, *batched put and delete*, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) algorithm.

**LevelUP** aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a **Node.js-friendly way**. All standard `Buffer` encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style **readable stream**.

LevelDB stores entries **sorted lexicographically by keys**. This makes LevelUP's <a href="#createReadStream"><code>ReadStream</code></a> interface a very powerful query mechanism.

**LevelUP** is an **OPEN Open Source Project**, see the <a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section to find out what this means.

Relationship to LevelDOWN
-------------------------

LevelUP is designed to be backed by **[LevelDOWN](https://github.com/level/leveldown/)** which provides a pure C++ binding to LevelDB and can be used as a stand-alone package if required.

**As of version 0.9, LevelUP no longer requires LevelDOWN as a dependency so you must `npm install leveldown` when you install LevelUP.**

LevelDOWN is now optional because LevelUP can be used with alternative backends, such as **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** in the browser or [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown) for a pure in-memory store.

LevelUP will look for LevelDOWN and throw an error if it can't find it in its Node `require()` path. It will also tell you if the installed version of LevelDOWN is incompatible.

**The [level](https://github.com/level/level) package is available as an alternative installation mechanism.** Install it instead to automatically get both LevelUP & LevelDOWN. It exposes LevelUP on its export (i.e. you can `var leveldb = require('level')`).
